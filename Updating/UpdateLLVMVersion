When updating to a new version of LLVM, you should verify that the enumerated constants
in the R code still correspond correctly to those in the LLVM header files. 
AttrKind is the one that has changed most often. 
Update the definition of LLVMAttributes (and FuncAttributes) in Function.R.
Use the R commands in TU/enums.R  (not in inst/TU/)



converters.cpp 
metadata.cpp  - activate getting names again!

[Test] Target.cpp  - ifdef'ed out the R_TargetMachine_getDataLayout() routine. Can get it from the Module, but not the target machine anymore.
[Test] IRBuilder.cpp
[Test] Module.cpp
[Test] ostream.cpp
[Test] ExecEngine.cpp - can we create a correct std::unique_ptr<llvm::Module> from R reference?

Test the handling of .get() for the std::unique_ptr<>. Do we still own it at the end or is it released??????
Test the error in ostream - treating as bool - do we get use !err or err?
