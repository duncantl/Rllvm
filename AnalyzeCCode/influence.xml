<section>
<title>Getting <r/> Type Information from <c/> Code</title>


<para>
We look at the influence.c file in the stats package in the base R code.
This has one routine named <c:func>influence</c:func>
which is invoked from R code via the <r:func>.Call</r:func> mechanism.
We are interested in programmatically determining what it returns.
In fact, it returns a list with either 3 or 4 elements.
In the case of 4 elements, these are named
hat, coefficients, sigma, wt.res.
If only 3 elements are returned, the coefficients is not included.
This is controlled by the second argument <c:var>do_coef</c:var>, a scalar logical.
<ul>
<li>hat is a numeric vector of length n, the number of rows in the QR matrix passed in the first argument to the routine.
</li>
<li>coefficients is a matrix with numeric elements and dimension n and k.
  k is the integer value in the mqr list (first argument) in the element named rank.</li>
<li>sigma is a numeric vector of length n</li>
<li>wt.res is the value passed in the third argument to the routine.
 It is also passed to the <fortran/> routine lminfl. (Are the values modified in the routine?)</li>
</ul>
</para>


<para>
  We start by generating the IR from the C code.
  We do this via a make file. However, here is the command
<sh:code>
/Users/duncan/LLVM/LLVM5.0.1/llvm-5.0.1.src/build/bin/clang -I/Users/duncan/R-3.4.4/include -DNDEBUG   -I/usr/local/include -fPIC -O2 -S -emit-llvm influence.c -o influence.ir
</sh:code>
Note that we need to use the same version of clang as the LLVM libraries we use in <omg:pkg>Rllvm</omg:pkg>.
</para>


<para>
<r:code>
library(Rllvm)
m = parseIR("influence.ir")   
</r:code>

<r:code>
names(m)
</r:code>

<r:code>
f = m$influence
b = getBlocks(f)  
</r:code>
There are 17 blocks
</para>

<para>

We find the return instruction(s):
<r:code>
w = sapply(b, function(x) any(sapply(x[], is, "ReturnInst")))
which(w)
</r:code>

<r:code>
ret = getTerminator(b[[which(w)]])
</r:code>
Alternatively, we can now use
<r:code>
ret = getReturnValues(f)[[1]]
</r:code>

<r:code>
ret[[1]]
#llvmDump(ret[[1]])
</r:code>
So this is a call to Rf_protect().
Of course, there is a corresponding call to Rf_unprotect() that takes place
later. We are not returning the call to Rf_protect().
LLVM/clang is merely pointing us to the place where the return value was initially created.
It is populated in code that is run before the return.

So we get the "code" for the object being protected
<r:code>
ret[[1]][[1]]  
#llvmDump(ret[[1]][[1]])
</r:code>
This is a call to Rf_allocVector.
We are now back in familiar territory (as in <ulink url="eg.R"/>)

We look at the first argument in the call to Rf_allocVector to find the type of the
R object:
<r:code>
ans = ret[[1]]
getValue(ans[[1]])
</r:code>
This returns 19 corresponding to VECSXP in Rinternals.h. (This is a regular/generic list.)


The number of elements is in the second element of <r:var>ans</r:var>
<r:code>
ans[[2]]
</r:code>
This is a SelectInst
<r:code>
llvmDump(ans[[2]])
<r:output><![CDATA[
%conv30 = select i1 %tobool29, i64 3, i64 4
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
Depending on the condition, the number of elements is either 3 or 4.
We can get these values with
<r:code>
sapply(ans[[2]][2:3], getValue)
</r:code>
since they are literal constants in this case.
If they were computations, we'd have to follow their contents.


The condition in the SelectInst
<r:code>
ans[[2]][[1]]
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "  %tobool29 = icmp eq i32 %9, 0"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
corresponds to the docoef in the <c/> code
which comes from
the value in the logical scalar passed to the routine as an argument <c:param>do_coef</c:param>,
i.e.,
<c:code>
int docoef = asLogical(do_coef);  
</c:code>



What is interesting about the <c:func>influence</c:func> routine is that
it inserts named elements into the list it returns and we want to know the types and the names of these elements.
</para>

<para>
Rather than looking at how the value of ans was created, let's look at the variable ans itself.
This was ans[[1]].
We can find where it is used directly and from this we get the users.
<r:code>
usrs = getAllUsers(ret) # [[1]]
</r:code>

<!--
<r:code>
#vals = lapply(u, getValue)
</r:code>
-->

We can look at the instructions that use this return value:
<r:code>
sapply(usrs, as, 'character')
<r:output><![CDATA[
  ret %struct.SEXPREC* %call32
  %call57 = call %struct.SEXPREC* @SET_VECTOR_ELT(%struct.SEXPREC* %call32, i64 %18, %struct.SEXPREC* %e) #3
  %call52 = call %struct.SEXPREC* @SET_VECTOR_ELT(%struct.SEXPREC* %call32, i64 %17, %struct.SEXPREC* %call16) #3
  %call46 = call %struct.SEXPREC* @SET_VECTOR_ELT(%struct.SEXPREC* %call32, i64 1, %struct.SEXPREC* %call13) #3
  %call39 = call %struct.SEXPREC* @SET_VECTOR_ELT(%struct.SEXPREC* %call32, i64 0, %struct.SEXPREC* %call8) #3
  %call37 = call %struct.SEXPREC* @Rf_setAttrib(%struct.SEXPREC* %call32, %struct.SEXPREC* %11, %struct.SEXPREC* %call36) #3
]]></r:output>  
</r:code>
<!-- no longer true: Note that these appear in reverse order. -->
</para>

<para>
There are 4 calls to SET_VECTOR_ELT, as we expect.
One of these is within an if() statement.
This is the second call.
So the elements of the list will be in a different order/positions
if this docoef condition is true or false.
</para>


<para>
Let's take a look at the 2nd user in our list <r:var>usrs</r:var>.
This corresponds to the first element to be added to the list.
We "know" that this is a call to SET_VECTOR_ELT (but we could check)
and that the first argument is the list we are returning.
We can query what value is being inserted
<r:code>
v = usrs[[2]]
v[[3]]
</r:code>
This is a call to Rf_protect.
It corresponds to the value of the local variable <c:var>hat</c:var>.
We can follow this object
<r:code>
getName(getCalledFunction(v[[3]][[1]]))  
</r:code>
to see <c:func>Rf_allocVector</c:func>.
And then we are back to the familiar and can find the type of R vector/object
and the length.
The type is 14
<r:code>
getValue(v[[3]][[1]][[1]])
</r:code>
corresponding to a REALSXP.
</para>
<para>
Here the length is not a constant, but computed:
<r:code>
v[[3]][[1]][[2]]
</r:code>
This is an instruction of class SExtInst.
This casts a value to an 64-bit integer.
What is the number:
<r:code>
v[[3]][[1]][[2]][[1]]  
<r:output><![CDATA[
"  %call2 = tail call i32 @Rf_nrows(%struct.SEXPREC* %call) #3"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
This is a call to Rf_nrows()
What is this being called with, or more importantly, which
R object are we getting the number of rows for?
<r:code>
v[[3]][[1]][[2]][[1]][[1]]
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "  %call = tail call %struct.SEXPREC* @getListElement(%struct.SEXPREC* %mqr, i8* getelementptr inbounds ([3 x i8], [3 x i8]* @.str, i64 0, i64 0)) #3"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
So this comes from the call <c:expr>nrows(qr)</c:expr> and <c:var>qr</c:var> comes from
<c:expr>qr = getListElement(mqr, "qr")</c:expr>.
</para>




<para>
  The basics of the following are partially implemented in <file>getType.R</file>
  (but not the <r:func>getType</r:func> function in <omg:pkg>Rllvm</omg:pkg>.)
  It needs more work, but gives the basics.
<r:code>
source("getType.R")
r = compReturnType(f)
class(r)
names(r)
r$length
r$elNames
sapply(r$els, class)
</r:code>

</para>


<para>
The last instruction in our list of users of the return value
sets the names attribute.
We can see this with
<r:code>
  usrs[[6]]
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "  %call37 = call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @Rf_setAttrib(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %call32, %struct.SEXPREC.8* %11, %struct.SEXPREC.8* %call36) #3"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
And the second argument to this is the symbol naming the attribute, and 
<r:code>
getName(usrs[[6]][[2]][[1]])
</r:code>  
gives <c:var>R_NamesSymbol</c:var> as the name of the global variable.
</para>

<para>
In this routine, the third argument to the call to Rf_setAttrib() is a call.
<r:code>
nmsVec = usrs[[6]][[3]]  
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "  %call36 = call %struct.SEXPREC* @Rf_allocVector(i32 16, i64 %conv35) #3"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
This allocates the character vector, but doesn't fill it in of course.
This comes in other code.
So, like the list we are returning, we have to find this call
and then which instructions use it to find the names of the elements.
</para>



<section>
<title>Finding the Names</title>

<para>
Let's pursue the names of the returned list to illustrate that it is the same
basic process as finding the elements of the list itself.

<r:code>
nu = getAllUsers(nmsVec)
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "  call void @SET_STRING_ELT(%struct.SEXPREC* %call36, i64 %18, %struct.SEXPREC* %call59) #3"
[2] "  call void @SET_STRING_ELT(%struct.SEXPREC* %call36, i64 %17, %struct.SEXPREC* %call55) #3"
[3] "  call void @SET_STRING_ELT(%struct.SEXPREC* %call36, i64 1, %struct.SEXPREC* %call49) #3"
[4] "  call void @SET_STRING_ELT(%struct.SEXPREC* %call36, i64 0, %struct.SEXPREC* %call42) #3"
[5] "  %call37 = call %struct.SEXPREC* @Rf_setAttrib(%struct.SEXPREC* %call32, %struct.SEXPREC* %11, %struct.SEXPREC* %call36) #3"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
Let's get the IR name of our <r:var>nmsVec</r:var> variable:
<r:code>
getName(nmsVec)
</r:code>
This is call36.
From the two outputs, we can see that 4 of the calls are to SET_STRING_ELT
with call36 (our IR variable) as the  first argument.
The final use is a call to Rf_setAttrib() and call36 is the final argument.
This final use is setting the names on the list to be returned by the routine.
We saw this earlier in the uses of the list itself (call32).
</para>



<para>
As with SET_VECTOR_ELT, the three arguments to SET_STRING_ELT are the vector, the position and the name element.
Let's look at the 4th of these calls to SET_STRING_ELT. This  corresponds to the first SET_STRING_ELT
call for this vector in the C code.
We get the position with
<r:code>
getValue(nu[[4]][[2]])  
</r:code>
This is the constant 0, i.e., the first element.
</para>



<para>
<r:code><![CDATA[
w = sapply(nu, function(x) is(x, "CallInst") && getName(getCalledFunction(x)) == "SET_STRING_ELT")
]]></r:code>
<r:code>
sapply(nu[w], function(x) findValue(x[[3]]))
</r:code>
</para>



<para>
Note that two of the calls to SET_STRING_ELT have literal values for the positions - 0 and 1.
These are not in the C code. Instead, that uses <c:var>nm</c:var> and increments that variable.
The second instance of this is within an if() statement.
However, the compiler has determined that these are the literal values and inserted
them as an optimization step.
</para>

<para>
What is the value that is being inserted, i.e., the name?
This is the third argument.  
In <r/>, we don't just insert the string. We need to create
a CHARSXP.
So this is a call to Rf_mkChar.
Its only argument is the string.
In this case, it is a literal value, a <r:class>ConstantExpr</r:class>.
LLVM stores this in a GlobalVariable within the module.

<fix>See findValue() in getType.R
Implement getting this. Can use the name of the .str.3
See code in class.R and getType.R and added to Rllvm.
Works, but may not be best way to do this. So probably needs
some robustifying.
<r:code>
ii = as(cexpr, "Instruction")
ii[[1]]  # GlobalVariable

getName(ii[[1]])

v = .Call("R_GlobalVariable_getInitializer", ii[[1]])

v is a Constant.

getValue(v)
fails 'don't know the class is of the Value"
It is "ConstantDataArray"


A different approach gives 4 values, but incorrect values.
m[[".str.1", value = TRUE]]


getValue(m[[".str.1"]]) # Now works - June 9

setMethod("show", "Value", function(x) print(as(x,'character')))

#getValue(ii[[1]])

# Operands
ii[[2]]
ii[[3]]
</r:code>
</fix>

</para>


<para>
Let's look at one of the 2 cases for which we don't have a literal value for position.
These are the first and second elements in our list of uses.
We look at the first and specifically its second argument
<r:code>
nu[[1]][[2]]
</r:code>
This is of class ZExtInst, a cast to an 64-bit integer from a regular 32 bit integer.
<r:output><![CDATA[
"  %18 = zext i32 %inc53 to i64"
]]></r:output>
The value being cast is in the first argument
<r:code>
as(nu[[1]][[2]][[1]], 'character')
</r:code>
<fix>We need to get the variable.  OverflowingBinaryOperator is just added, but its first element from R is the 1.
<r:code>
bof = nu[[1]][[2]][[1]]
getOpcode(bof) # add
</r:code>
</fix>
</para>

</section>


<para>
Let's look at SET_VECTOR_ELT inside the if() body.
This is
<r:code>
i = usrs[[4]]
</r:code>
We can get the block/parent of this with
<r:code>
getParent(i)
</r:code>
We have lost the "if" aspect in the IR
that we had in the AST.
The "if" is in the name of the block and other labels.
</para>

<para>
We can find which blocks lead to this block.
<r:code>
a = getPredecessor(getParent(i))
</r:code>

We look at the terminator to see what condition brings us to
the body of the if statement in which the SET_VECTOR_ELT occurs.
<r:code>
br = getTerminator(a)
</r:code>
This is a simple branch.
We branch to the SET_VECTOR_ELT part if this false.
We know this because 
<r:code>
identical(getSuccessor(br, 2), getParent(i))
</r:code>
is <r:true/>.

</para>
<para>
The condition for the branch is
<r:code>
cond = br[[1]]
</r:code>
and looks like
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "  %tobool43 = icmp eq i32 %12, 0"
]]></r:output>
This involves the variable named %12 in the IR.
We can get this variable by accessing the first element
of the condition.
This is a LoadInst, so we follow that to get
<r:code>
getName(cond[[1]][[1]])
</r:code>
Here we asked for the name.
<r:code>
getType(cond[[1]][[1]])
</r:code>
</para>


<section>
<title>Types of the Elements</title>

<para>
For the returned list, we find the code that inserts the elements into the list:
<r:code><![CDATA[
w = sapply(usrs, function(x) is(x, "CallInst") && getName(getCalledFunction(x)) == "SET_VECTOR_ELT")
]]></r:code>
Now we can get the values  of the objects being inserted
<r:code>
  vals = lapply(usrs[w], `[[`, 3)
<r:output><![CDATA[
[[1]]
[1] "%struct.SEXPREC.8* %e"

[[2]]
[1] "  %call16 = tail call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @Rf_protect(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %call15) #3"

[[3]]
[1] "  %call13 = tail call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @Rf_protect(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %call12.sink) #3"

[[4]]
[1] "  %call8 = tail call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @Rf_protect(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %call7) #3"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
We can follow these and get their type.
</para>

<para>
  The first of these is just an Argument/parameter, specifically the one named 'e'.
  We know it is a generic <r/> object.
  We can examine the code to see if we can deduce more specific information, or we
  can check the <r/> code that calls the <c:func>influence</c:func> routine.
  There is a call <c:expr>REAL(e)</c:expr> which indicates it is a numeric vector or matrix.
  We find all the users of this with
<r:code>
getAllUsers(vals[[1]]) # or m$influence$e
</r:code>
We see only 2 - the insertion into the result and the call to <c:func>REAL</c:func>.
</para>

<para>
  The second element of <r:var>vals</r:var> is
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "  %call16 = tail call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @Rf_protect(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %call15) #3"
]]></r:output>
We get the argument to <c:func>Rf_protect</c:func> and see
<r:output><![CDATA[
"  %call15 = tail call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @Rf_allocVector(i32 14, i64 %conv) #3"
]]></r:output>
We pass this to <r:func>getCallType</r:func> in <file>getType.R</file>
and get back
<r:output><![CDATA[
$type
[1] "REALSXP"

$length
NULL

attr(,"class")
[1] "RVector"
]]></r:output>
indicating a numeric vector. We don't currently implement the mechanism
to get the length for this vector, but we can extend this.
It is somewhat involved here. This leads to a call to
<c:expr>Rf_nrows(obj)</c:expr> and the <c:var>obj</c:var> is
the call <c:expr>getListElement(mqr, "qr")</c:expr>.
This involves chasing down the "qr" constant (easy enough). But we don't know at compile
time to which element of mqr that corresponds. So we can resolve this statically.
</para>


<para>
  The third element potentially inserted into the result is
<r:output><![CDATA[
"  %call13 = tail call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @Rf_protect(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %call12.sink) #3"
]]></r:output>  
Again, we pass this to <r:func>getCallType</r:func>.
<r:output><![CDATA[
[[1]]
$type
[1] "REALSXP"

$length
[1] 0

attr(,"class")
[1] "RVector"

[[2]]
$type
[1] "REALSXP"

$dims
$dims$nrow
NULL

$dims$ncol
NULL


attr(,"class")
[1] "RMatrix"

]]></r:output>
We get a list with 2 elements as the result.
This is because there are two possible values.
One is a numeric vector and the other is a numeric matrix.
These two cases come from the fact that <c:var>coefficients</c:var>
is initialized conditionally.
In the first case, we create a vector of length 0 and we captured that.
We did not currently get the dimensions for the matrix case.
</para>
<para>
  We can follow the matrix dimensions.
  <r:code>
vals[[3]][[1]][[2]][[2]]    
<r:output><![CDATA[
 "  %call2 = tail call i32 @Rf_nrows(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %call) #3"
 ]]></r:output>
  </r:code>
So we are computing the number of rows.
When we look at the object, we see
<r:code>
vals[[3]][[1]][[2]][[2]][[1]]  
<r:output><![CDATA[
"  %call = tail call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @getListElement(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %mqr, i8* getelementptr inbounds ([3 x i8], [3 x i8]* @.str, i64 0, i64 0)) #3"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
We are back to the situation we had above with getListElement() with a named element.
</para>


<para>
Finally, we look at the last of the <r:var>vals</r:var> elements
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "  %call8 = tail call %struct.SEXPREC.8* @Rf_protect(%struct.SEXPREC.8* %call7) #3"
]]></r:output>
Again, <r:func>getCallType</r:func> returns 
<r:output><![CDATA[
$type
[1] "REALSXP"

$length
NULL

attr(,"class")
[1] "RVector"
]]></r:output>
i.e., a numeric vector.
Again, the length is related to the getListElement() call.
</para>
