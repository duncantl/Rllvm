<title>Rllvm Todo List</title>

<topic>
<title>General</title>
<items>


<item>
    Version 7.0.1  - Value::dump() and Type::dump() symbols missing from the LLVM libraries when Rllvm.so is loaded.
</item>
<item>
  In tests/ addOne.R, getAssemblyCode(m) gives
  <error>
    "R_TargetMachine_addPassesToEmitFile" not resolved from current namespace (Rllvm)
  </error>
  It is #if 0'ed out in src/Target.cpp. Now reenabled and add a NULL value for the
  third argument to addPassesToEmitFile() which is the raw_pwrite_stream *DwoOut parameter.
</item>
  
<item status="done">
See in Rllvm if we can run optimizer passes and then look at the resulting IR?
Does this even make sense? Specifically thinking of mem2reg and seeing the alloca disappear
and the phi nodes appear.
<br/>
Of course!

<item>
Examine the assembler code generated.  See tests/emitCode.R
</item>

<item status="done">
Compile against 3.9.1 - tests/addOne.R fails.
<br/>
Type of return doesn't match type of declared return type!
Is this a global context issue? No it is that the variable Add is not from
BinaryOps anymore but overwritten by a later enum.

<item>
experiments/array.R doesn't seem to be working.
Getting the array "m" after calling foo() doesn't get the updated values.
</item>

<item status="done">
Should getTerminator() set the class from the actual class of the instruction or just use the  generic TerminatorInst ?
<br/>
Now, Optionally done with genericClass = FALSE.
</item>

 <item status="done">
Set the target on a module?
getDefaultTargetTriple() gets us the value. How to set it?
<br/>
setTargetTriple(mod, triple)
 </item>


<item status="done">
<r:code>
str = getDataLayoutString()
setDataLayout(m, str)
</r:code> 

<br/>
Add the target  and datalayout string to a Module.
Needed for getAssemblyCode()
<br/>
getDefaultTargetTriple()

We can get the datalayout string with
tm = createTargetMachine()
.Call("R_TargetMachine_getDataLayoutString", tm)
Then how do we set it on the Module.
Do we set the DataLayout() itself. How do we get the DataLayout() as TargetMachine returns it not as a reference.
</item>

<item status="done">
Parsing a module from a string doesn't seem to want to work.
In the CompilerBook directory, 
<r:code>
library(Rllvm)
m1 = parseIR("Rllvm/fib_basic_unoptimized.ll")
m2 = parseIR( as(m1, "character"), asText = TRUE)
</r:code>
We weren't release()'ing  the unique pointer.
</item>


<item>
When printing a Function object (or Module, etc.) , check it is still valid.

<item status="done">
lapply/sapply methods for a block to loop over the instructions

 show() methods for Instructions and BasicBlock call llvmDump() ?
</item>

<item>
Allow putting comments on instructions, e.g., what the literal R type corresponds to symbolically STRSXP
<br/>
Use instruction-level metadata?
</item>

<item status="done">
parseIR() should raise an error if the file isn't there or the contents are empty or we don't get a Module back.
<br/>
Problem was system.file() returning "". So now check this.
</item>


<item status="verify">
getDataLayout  - the C++ level object is on the stack so can't take its address and have it persist.
</item>

<item status="check">
Do we support putting metadata on an instruction. Appears not!
And on a function?
KindID, Kind and MDNode?
</item>

<item status="low">
Should setMetadata() return the NamedMDNode?
</item>

<item status="done">
Don't seem to be able to invoke routines with arbitrary signatures.
The runFunction routine in the MCJIT seems very limited.
We may have to use the Rffi/rdyncall package directly.
</item>

<item>
tests/metadata.R  lists not working.
</item>

<item>
Avoid the duplicate enum variable names, e.g., Add in BinOp and BinaryOps. We need the second.
<br/>
Should we expose/include those for anonymous enums?
Which ones are actually used/needed? We can look through the methods we support and 
their arguments and return types and look for enums.
<br/>

When there are duplicates, how do we want to handle this.
Consider the 
BinaryOps::Add and BinOp::Add.
Clearly, we can have Add in the *Values vector for each.
The only issue is the "loose" variable Add for each which will conflict.
We could use the unusual/overloaded name
<r:code>
`BinOp::Add`
</r:code>
This is the name of a symbol in R
</item>


<item status="done">
parseIR("loop.ll") fails.
<br/>
Works fine if generated with the corresponding version of clang as the llvm used
by Rllvm.
<sh:code>
clang -S -emit-llvm  loop.c -o loop.ll
</sh:code>
<c:code>
void
foo()
{
    double x = 0;
    while(1) {
	x++;

tests/gep.R and uncomment the last line to create the GEP
<br/>
Works: 
<pre>
tests/stringpointer.R
tests/stringpointer2.R
</pre>
</item>

<item status="check">
Verify we are using the MCJIT and machine code and not an interpreter.
<br/>
Use lldb? Compare speed?
<br/>
Sure seems like we are using it in terms of speed.
See the test code in src/mjit.c that  we wrote to call test_fib multiple times.
We seem off by about 10%.

Sort out the new PassManager.

<c:code><![CDATA[

]]></c:code>
</item>

<item>
Generate MIR code.
<br/>
See bottom of Module.cpp.
Do we need the new PassManager or the legacy::PassManager.
If the latter, then the add() method doesn't work since MIRPass is a FunctionPass, not a Pass.
If we use the new <![CDATA[PassManager<llvm::Function>]]>, then we 
<br/>
Did we see this in llvm-src/tools/llc/llc.cpp?  It seems to have been there, but not now.
See http://llvm-cs.pcc.me.uk/tools/llc/llc.cpp
</item>

<item>
Ensure enums are correct. (In RCIndex and RCUDA)
</item>

<item status="done">
Check the code that generates the raw assembler code (x86 instructions) properly terminates the string.
tests/emitCode.R or tests/addOne.R
<br/>
raw_svector_ostream doesn't ensure NULL terminated string. So we use mkCharLen().
</item>

<item>
Some of the enums exceed the maximum integer size. Change how we generate the code to recognize this and leave them as
numeric.  Change code that expects an integer to check and deal with the potentially larger values, i.e. don't convert
to int.

Do we need the specific methods for getOperands, etc.??
Don't think so!

Function[] returning too many values.
In RLLVMCompile in source("BML2.R"), the code

          mapply(function(type, arg) {
                      if(isPointerType(type))

Why does creating the passManager() with a module not 
do the same thing as creating it with no module and then 
call run(mgr, module)
</item>

<item>
test getCppClasses().  Use inst/TU/clang.R.  Failing in assigning params
for Links.

Setting attribute on an argument requires now to specify the
index of the argument, first arugment starting at 1 in C++.

Ways to get the specific instruction type,
e.g. when getOperand(), just get back generic Value object.
Could use dynamic casts and exhaustively find one that works!

update the enums for 3.3. The TypeIDs were off. Manually fixed.

Make declareFunction accept a Type, list(Type, Type) 
rather than just a single list() with the return type and parameter types.
</item>

<item>
When we read IR back into R, lose the specific SEXP type information on the function.
</item>


<item>
When a parameter type is one of the SEXP types, then coerce the input to that type.
Perhaps too much overhead. Also, we just have the generic SEXPType 
at this point.  Could create derived C++ classes to represent the different types
or a single one that had the SEXP type(of). Then the types wouldn't necessarily be unique.
But can make it so. Just use a static method to get it for the different sexp types.
<br/>
Try to find a way to get the different SEXP types as their own
types but compatible with the generic SEXP type.
Could cast.
</item>

<item>
How to handle a struct as a parameter.
Have to match the ABI.
Does it depend on the nature of the elements of the struct.
<br/>
See tests/struct.R and also the CXCursor example ( exists ? where?)
</item>

<item status="low">
[Needs to be implemented in LLVM]
Allow calling varargs functions directly.
See varargs.R
<r:code>
.llvm(pf, "result: %d ***\n", 34L)
</r:code>
Currently, runFunction in LLVM doesn't support this.
Assertion: "This doesn't support passing arguments through varargs (yet)!"
</item>


<item>
Add a finalizer routine to a Module and when we garbage collect it, 
then we can call it.
This can release global variables in the module, e.g. regular expressions.
Have to ensure that no elements of the module are still assigned in R.
Maybe borrow code from RCIndex for reference counting.
</item>

<item status="finish">
R print method for Function to show the signature. 
<r:func>getTypeName</r:func>.
Possibly for Module also, e.g. to show the names of the elements, perhaps their type.

get attributes for a Function object. 
See funcAttributes.R.
Problem with a spurious number appearing at end 'nocapture align 1073741824'.
Are we setting these on the functions when we are supposed to be setting on a parameter.
If we just set NoUnwind, then things are fine.
really make sense.
Resulting IR cannot be read.
<br/>
[Done] How do we work with the AttrListPtr.
</item>

<item>
Allow Adding passes to the pass manager - e.g. the AlwaysInlinerPass.
addPass() function exists.
Constructors for different passes.

InitializeNVPTXTarget() and generating code for PTX.

See https://github.com/halide/Halide/blob/master/src/cllutil.c

<ol>
<li>initialize the NVPTXTarget.</li>
<li>set the triple on the module</li>
<li>lookupTarget(triple)</li>
<li>create and fill in a TargetOptions struct</li>
<li>create the TargetMachine object (TheTarget->createTargetMachine())</li>
<li>create, fill in and then run pass manager. Set targetLibraryInfo in the PassManager,
along with other information from the machine and module</li>
</ol>

How do we get the code back from LLVM so that we can pass it to CUDA?
How do we run the code on the GPU?
Can we use cuModuleLoadData?
Can we get the address of the function from the execution engine?
<br/>
See libNVVM.
</item>


<item status="done">
Should use the pointer for the global variable to set it,
just like we do when we get it. We need the type.
<r:code>
library(Rllvm)
InitializeNativeTarget()
mod = Module("global")
mod[["status"]] = TRUE
showModule(mod)
</r:code>
doesn't set the value if the variable has already been created.
It only sets it the first time.
Actually it creates a new variable with a 1 added to the name!
<r:code>
library(Rllvm)
InitializeNativeTarget()
mod = Module("global")
mod[["status"]] = TRUE
showModule(mod)
setInitializer(mod[["status"]], createLogicalConstant(FALSE))
showModule(mod)
mod[["status"]] = TRUE
</r:code>
<br/>

The getGlobalVariable() functions and the setting of these values
don't behave as expected. The get() function gets the initial value.
The set values don't set the variable if it already exists.
This will change in the future.
The get value doesn't get the new value, just the initialization value.
See tests/clone2.R
<br/>
This is probably just a mistaken understanding/analysis of the outcomes.
Need to use the same Execution Engine to see the changes.

<item status="done">
Fix getting function attributes for 3.2
(Getting back a list with an element for each attribute,
but each has the entire set.
Working on the slots.)
</item>

<item status="done">
[Basically done but ... and test with 3.2]
[need to update enums  - AttrKind for FuncAttributes]
[configuration done]

sort out the changes to the Attributes and AttributeSet.
Determine in configure what we are dealing with and
set NEW_LLVM_ATTRIBUTES_SETUP appropriately
and export to Makevars.in.
<br/>
Things compile now for 3.3, but don't work. tests/funcAttributes.R
For add.ll, settings on foo are returning correctly from query.
But setting is not working.  It is if we update the enum  values.

Shutdown and restart.
See RLLVMCompile/tests/serialize.R

<item status="low">
THIS WORKS now, but not certain why the type is wrong
<br/>
When trying to get value of a global variable in a module before it is set,
<r:expr>m[[varName, ee = ee]]</r:expr> throws an error.
It comes from getGlobalValue() which calls the C routine
convertNativeValuePtrToR() and it thinks the type is an Array.
See RLLVMCompile/explorations/callbacksSerialize.R and the <r:expr>m[[ ]]</r:expr> call before 
invoking the LLVM routine.

See explorations/globalString.R and 
specifically

Do we have to dereference the pointer to get the actual
address of the data?
Seems fixed now (in git: 19ca87e)
</item>

<item>
Function to link two or more modules
so that we can compile functions separately and then
allow them to refer to each other.
Perhaps hierarchies of modules?
Use addGlobalMapping() explicitly to connect one routine to another module?
No, use the Linker::LinkModules() method?
What about the need for external linkage, the declaration, etc.
when we make a call to the routine that isn't in the module.
<br/>
We can insert new modules into the execution engine. See addModule().
We also would like to pass the compiler a collection
of modules so that it can find existing Functions in those.
</item>

<item>
Rf_length and other routines not available via getNativeSymbolInfo()
