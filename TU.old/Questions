Q Why does
 sapply(llvm, getFileName)
include files from LLVM3.8 when we were focusing on LLVM3.9

Answer: Because RCIndex is installed against LLVM3.8 and so it looks for the 
 standard C++ files in that location.

Q Why duplicate class names in `llvm`, e.g. LoopBase?
Anwer: Templates and then specific instantiation of the template.
How many templates do we have?
  table(sapply(llvm, function(x) names(x$kind)))

    CXCursor_ClassDecl CXCursor_ClassTemplate 
                   354                    279
